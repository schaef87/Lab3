/**
 * List class (Lab 3/Lab 4) configuration file.
 * Activate test #N by defining the corresponding LAB3_TESTN to have the value 1.
 *
 * Because you will copy the List class code to your ordered list directory, having 
 * two "config.h" files presented the risk of accidentally replacing the one in the
 * ordered list directory. So the two configuration files are combined for labs 3 and 4.
 *
 * NOTE!!! There was an error in the printed book. TEST1 shows up twice in the book.
 * The basic List implementation uses TEST1 as described below, then exercise 2
 * is activated by TEST2
